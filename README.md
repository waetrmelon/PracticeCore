# PracticeCore
 Minecraft 1.7 x 1.8 Spigot Practice Core.
 You are free to use this Plugin and edit this Plugin to your desires, although its prohibited to claim the code is entirely made by you, references to this github page or my github page will be greatly appreciated if you are using this source.

 This practice plugin features:
  - Queueing System
  - Matchmaking System
  - Scoreboard(s)
  - Inventory GUI(s)
  - NoDebuff duel, although haven't added the kit, adding the kit is fairly easy.

 I've attempted to structure the code in a manner where any user that is attempting to edit the source finds it not as frustrating, meaning that if you wish to add a new duel type you just have to do some copy and pasting, and practically isn't very involving, making it easy to add new features.
 
 You will need to write a Arena loading system as I didn't get around to developing it.
